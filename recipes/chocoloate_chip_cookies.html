    <h2>How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How long to bake chocolate chip cookies</h3>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the cool).</p>
